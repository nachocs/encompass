The first pattern I found was that all the prime numbers would only be touched once. They would be opened by the person with locker #1 and closed by the person with the prime #. I then created a list of all the prime numbers to start to eliminate possibilities. From there, I started to write down the remaining numbers (4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, â€¦) and also writing each of the numbers that are factors of the remaining numbers. Quite quickly, I noticed a pattern. The pattern I noticed was that only the numbers whose square root was a whole number resulted in the locker being opened. This is how I answered the first question.</span></p>`
