      statement: 'A narrow strip of very flexible elastic is firmly fastened to a wooden table top at two points (A and B) 30 centimeters apart. While the strip lies FLAT on the table, a point C is located that divides AB in a 1 : 4 ratio.\nYou now take hold of the strip at point C and begin slowly lifting it vertically. As you do this, the elastic segments AC and BC stretch out and form an obtuse angle.\nAs you lift higher, the measurement of the angle decreases. If you go sufficiently high, you will have an acute angle. But at some moment in this process, there will be a height at which angle ACB is a right angle.\nPlease tell me that height.\nExtra: What is the perimeter of this triangle ACB? [Recall that AC and CB are made of the elastic strip, whereas AB is merely the undrawn line on the table top.] Give your answer rounded to the nearest millimeter.',
